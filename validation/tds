opt. phonons 1e12 - 1e13 Hz

takes 0.7e-16 s to traverse specimen

--> incoherent averaging

frozen phonon:

The final image or diffraction pattern is the intensity averaged over several different configurations of atoms with different random offsets (average |ψ |2 and not ψ )

einstein model:

random offsets can be generated using a random number generator with
a Gaussian distribution Kittel [211]
